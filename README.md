# PySpark Course (Basic Examples and Tasks)

Navigate through the folders in this repository to see instructions.

Each directory is a lesson that contains a Python code `main.py` and instructions `README.md`. In the end of each `README.md` there are tasks for selfcheck.

We encourage a learner to use any search engine they like to find solutions for the tasks and to consult with the latest PySpark [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/).

The course is structured as follows:  
* **0_installation**  
contains only installation guide  
(the expected result is an evironment with PySpark installed);
* **0_python_basics**   
is a small introduction to Python with a set of basic examples;  
* **1_map_reduce**  
is about two abstractions of functional programming that are heavily utilized by distributed computing: `map` and `reduce`;  
* **3_rdd_in_spark**  
introduction to Resilent Distributed Dataset -- a primary API in Spark;
*  **4_dataframes**  
usage of DataFrames -- a higher-level API in Spark;
* **5_streaming**  
is about structured streaming in Spark  (streaming of data within the DataFrame abstraction);
* **6_machine_learning**  
is an example of Spark ML usage.
